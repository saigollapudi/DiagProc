Experimenting with code that would do some image processing to detect symbols in a scientific diagram. 
Currently I am working with JavaFX code. 
I have also tryed some iPythod code for some web app development... but I find that most of my diagrams are going to be on desktop in private collections (e.g. enterprise process models)
